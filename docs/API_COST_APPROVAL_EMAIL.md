Subject: Approval Required: API Budget for Leadership AI Avatar Platform (EXL Summit)

Dear Team,

To deliver the high-quality, gamified experience required for the Leadership AI Avatar Platform at the EXL Summit, we need to utilize two key AI services for voice cloning and video lip-syncing. 

I am requesting approval for a total estimated budget of **~$80-90** to cover these services for the duration of development and the event.

### 1. ElevenLabs (Voice Cloning)
**Purpose:** Generates realistic, cloned voices for our leadership avatars (Vikram, Anil, Ishraq) instead of standard robotic TTS.
*   **Current Limit:** $20
*   **Anticipated Cost:** **$25 - $30**
*   **Justification:** The standard tier ($22/mo) provides ~100,000 characters. Given the expected interaction volume (100+ sessions), we may slightly exceed the base limit.

### 2. Fal.ai (Video Lip-Sync)
**Purpose:** transform static avatar images into talking-head videos that lip-sync perfectly with the generated audio. This creates the "real-time video" experience requested.
*   **Anticipated Cost:** **$50 - $60**
*   **Justification:** This is a pay-as-you-go service (~$0.01 per generation). For 100 sessions with multiple turns per conversation, this budget ensures we don't hit usage caps during the live demo.

### Summary
*   **ElevenLabs:** ~$30
*   **Fal.ai:** ~$60
*   **Total Request:** **~$90**

Please let me know if we can proceed with provisioning these credits to ensure the platform is ready for the summit.

Best regards,
