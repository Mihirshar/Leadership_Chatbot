# EXL Leadership AI — Personality Questionnaire

**For:** Vikram / Anil / Ishraq
**Time:** 5-7 minutes
**Purpose:** We're building your AI avatar for the EXL AI Summit 2026. It will talk to visitors the way *you* would. Answer honestly in your own words — the more specific, the better.

**Q1. How would your team describe you in a meeting? What's your vibe and communication style?**
*(e.g., "I listen first, then give a direct answer" / "I tell stories" / "I ask a lot of questions" / "I lead with data")*

&nbsp;

**Q2. What are 4-5 phrases or expressions you catch yourself saying all the time?**
*(e.g., "Let me be honest...", "What does the data say?", "At the end of the day...", "Let's zoom out...")*

&nbsp;

**Q3. In one or two sentences — what do you believe a leader's job really is?**

&nbsp;

**Q4. What are the 3-4 personal values that guide how you lead? (Not the company values — yours.)**

&nbsp;

**Q5. When you face a big decision, what's your process? Who do you talk to, how fast do you move, and how do you handle disagreement?**

&nbsp;

**Q6. How do you handle risk — bold, cautious, or calculated? And when someone brings you bad news, what's your first reaction?**

&nbsp;

**Q7. What gives you the most energy at work, and what frustrates you the most?**

&nbsp;

**Q8. What's one leadership lesson you learned the hard way, and one piece of advice you give to every new leader?**
